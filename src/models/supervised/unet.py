        Implements a unet, a network where the input is downscaled
        down to a lower resolution with a higher amount of channels,
        but the residual images between encoders are saved
        to be concatednated to later stages, creatin the
        nominal "U" shape.

        In order to do this, we will need n_encoders-1 encoders. 
        The first layer will be a doubleconvhelper that
        projects the in_channels image to an embedding_size
        image of the same size.

        After that, n_encoders-1 encoders are used which halve
        the size of the image, but double the amount of channels
        available to them (i.e, the first layer is 
        embedding_size -> 2*embedding size, the second layer is
        2*embedding_size -> 4*embedding_size, etc)

        The decoders then upscale the image and halve the amount of
        embedding layers, i.e., they go from 4*embedding_size->2*embedding_size.

        We then have a maxpool2d that scales down the output to by scale_factor,
        as the input for this architecture must be the same size as the output,
        but our input images are 800x800 and our output images are 16x16.
